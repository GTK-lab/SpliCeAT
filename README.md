# SpliCeAT: Integrated pipeline for detection and quantification of aberrant transcripts with novel splicing events

This repository contains the following snakemakes:
1. Majiq
2. Whippet
3. Leafcutter
4. Augmented transcriptome analysis

Start here: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ys-lim/SpliCeAT.git
```

[^1]: Unless otherwise stated, all RNA-seq alignments are performed with STAR. The pipelines assume BAM files are labelled as `sample_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`.
